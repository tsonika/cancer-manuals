Specifically, it describes genetic\nvariation in three African individuals sequenced as part of the 1000\nGenomes Project (\nhttp://www.1000genomes.org\n). The \u2019vcf\u2019 extension lets\nus know that it\u2019s in a specific text format, namely \u2019Variant Call\nFormat\u2019. The file starts with a bunch of comment lines (they start with\n\u2019#\u2019 or \u2019##\u2019), and then a large number of data lines.

For a better understanding of\nthe consequences please check the data quality!\n\n\nFor the purpose of this tutorial we are focusing only on Illumina\nsequencing which uses \u2019sequence by synthesis\u2019 technology in a highly\nparallel fashion. Although Illumina high throughput sequencing provides\nhighly accurate sequence data, several sequence artifacts, including\nbase calling errors and small insertions/deletions, poor quality reads\nand primer/adapter contamination are quite common in the high throughput\nsequencing data. The primary errors are substitution errors. The error\nrates can vary from 0.5-2.0% with errors mainly rising in frequency at\nthe 3\u2019 ends of reads.\n\n\nOne way to investigate sequence data quality is to visualize the quality\nscores and other metrics in a compact manner to get an idea about the\nquality of a read data set. Read data sets can be improved by pre\nprocessing in different ways like trimming off low quality bases,\ncleaning up any sequencing adapters, removing PCR duplicates and\nscreening for contamination. We can also look at other statistics such\nas, sequence length distribution, base composition, sequence complexity,\npresence of ambiguous bases etc. to assess the overall quality of the\ndata set.\n\n\nHighly redundant coverage (>15X) of the genome can be used to correct\nsequencing errors in the reads before assembly. Various k-mer based\nerror correction methods exist but are beyond the scope of this\ntutorial.\n\n\nQuality Value Encoding Schema\n\u00b6\n\n\nQuality scoring calculates a set of predictors for each base call, and then uses the predictor values to look up the Q-score in a quality table. Quality tables are created to provide optimally accurate quality predictions for runs generated by a specific configuration of sequencing platform and version of chemistry [\nwww.illumina.com\n].\nIn order to use a single character to encode Phred qualities, ASCII\ncharacters are used\n(\nhttp://shop.alterlinks.com/ascii-table/ascii-table-us.php\n). All ASCII\ncharacters have a decimal number associated with them but the first 32\ncharacters are non-printable (e.g. backspace, shift, return, escape).\nTherefore, the first printable ASCII character is number 33, the\nexclamation mark (!). In Phred+33 encoded quality values the exclamation\nmark takes the Phred quality score of zero.\n\n\nEarly Solexa (now Illumina) sequencing needed to encode negative quality\nvalues. Because ASCII characters < 33 are non-printable, using the\nPhred+33 encoding was not possible. Therefore, they simply moved the\noffset from 33 to 64 thus inventing the Phred+64 encoded quality values.\nIn this encoding a Phred quality of zero is denoted by the ASCII number\n64 (the @ character). Since Illumina 1.8, quality values are now encoded\nusing Phred+33.\n\n\nFASTQ does not provide a way to describe what quality encoding is used\nfor the quality values. Therefore, you should find this out from your\nsequencing provider. Alternatively, you may be able to figure this out\nby determining what ASCII characters are present in the FASTQ file. E.g\nthe presence of numbers in the quality strings, can only mean the\nquality values are Phred+33 encoded. However, due to the overlapping\nnature of the Phred+33 and Phred+64 encoding schema it is not always\npossible to identify what encoding is in use. For example, if the only\ncharacters seen in the quality string are (\n@ABCDEFGHI\n), then it is\nimpossible to know if you have really good Phred+33 encoded qualities or\nreally bad Phred+64 encoded qualities.\n\n\nFor a graphical representation of the different ASCII characters used in\nthe two encoding schema see:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Encoding\n.\n\n\nQ-score encoding implemented with the Novaseq platform\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to reduce the data footrpints Illumina has come up with a new\nmethod to reduce quality score resolution and optimise data storae. The new Q-score \nencoding now follows an 8 level mapping of individual quality scores (0-40 or >40) [See Table 1].\nWith the new scoring scheme the original scores 20-24 may form one bin and the quality scores in that \nbin mapped to a new value of 22. This can be thought of as simply replacing all the \noccurrences of scores 20, 21, 23, 24 with a new score of 22 in the output sequence.\nIllumina claims that with the new Q-scoring system the reduction in the Illumina raw sequence format (.bcl) is typically > 50% and the resulting sorted BAM  les are reduced by ~30%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality Score Bins\n\n\nMapped quality scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN (no call)\n\n\nN (no call)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-9\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10-19\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20-24\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25-29\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30-34\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35-39\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>=40\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Novaseq Q-score bins mapping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepare the Environment\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo investigate sequence data quality we will demonstrate tools called\nFastQC and Skewer.

For the purpose of this tutorial we are focusing only on Illumina\nsequencing which uses \u2019sequence by synthesis\u2019 technology in a highly\nparallel fashion. Although Illumina high throughput sequencing provides\nhighly accurate sequence data, several sequence artifacts, including\nbase calling errors and small insertions/deletions, poor quality reads\nand primer/adapter contamination are quite common in the high throughput\nsequencing data. The primary errors are substitution errors. The error\nrates can vary from 0.5-2.0% with errors mainly rising in frequency at\nthe 3\u2019 ends of reads.  One way to investigate sequence data quality is to visualize the quality\nscores and other metrics in a compact manner to get an idea about the\nquality of a read data set. Read data sets can be improved by pre\nprocessing in different ways like trimming off low quality bases,\ncleaning up any sequencing adapters, removing PCR duplicates and\nscreening for contamination. We can also look at other statistics such\nas, sequence length distribution, base composition, sequence complexity,\npresence of ambiguous bases etc. to assess the overall quality of the\ndata set.  Highly redundant coverage (>15X) of the genome can be used to correct\nsequencing errors in the reads before assembly.

            "text": "Quality scoring calculates a set of predictors for each base call, and then uses the predictor values to look up the Q-score in a quality table. Quality tables are created to provide optimally accurate quality predictions for runs generated by a specific configuration of sequencing platform and version of chemistry [ www.illumina.com ].\nIn order to use a single character to encode Phred qualities, ASCII\ncharacters are used\n( http://shop.alterlinks.com/ascii-table/ascii-table-us.php ). All ASCII\ncharacters have a decimal number associated with them but the first 32\ncharacters are non-printable (e.g. backspace, shift, return, escape).\nTherefore, the first printable ASCII character is number 33, the\nexclamation mark (!). In Phred+33 encoded quality values the exclamation\nmark takes the Phred quality score of zero.  Early Solexa (now Illumina) sequencing needed to encode negative quality\nvalues. Because ASCII characters < 33 are non-printable, using the\nPhred+33 encoding was not possible. Therefore, they simply moved the\noffset from 33 to 64 thus inventing the Phred+64 encoded quality values.\nIn this encoding a Phred quality of zero is denoted by the ASCII number\n64 (the @ character). Since Illumina 1.8, quality values are now encoded\nusing Phred+33.  FASTQ does not provide a way to describe what quality encoding is used\nfor the quality values. Therefore, you should find this out from your\nsequencing provider. Alternatively, you may be able to figure this out\nby determining what ASCII characters are present in the FASTQ file. E.g\nthe presence of numbers in the quality strings, can only mean the\nquality values are Phred+33 encoded. However, due to the overlapping\nnature of the Phred+33 and Phred+64 encoding schema it is not always\npossible to identify what encoding is in use. For example, if the only\ncharacters seen in the quality string are ( @ABCDEFGHI ), then it is\nimpossible to know if you have really good Phred+33 encoded qualities or\nreally bad Phred+64 encoded qualities.  For a graphical representation of the different ASCII characters used in\nthe two encoding schema see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Encoding .",

We\nwill align raw sequencing data to the human genome using the BWA aligner\nand then we will discuss the sequence alignment and mapping format\n(SAM). SAM to BAM conversion, indexing and sorting will also be\ndemonstrated. These are important and essential steps for downstream\nprocessing of the aligned BAM files.\n\n\nThis data is the whole genome sequencing of a lung adenocarcinoma\npatient AK55. It was \ndownloaded\n from\n\nERP001071\n. Only the HiSeq2000 data for \nBlood\n and \nliverMets\n were analysed.\n\n\nAccession numbers associated with read data are assigned by the European\nBioinformatics Institute (EBI) and start with \u2019ER\u2019. e.g. ERP is the study ID\nand ERR is the run ID. The original FASTQ files downloaded had the ERR\nnumber in front of each read name in the FASTQ file (e.g. @ERRxx HWI-ST478_xxxx). The read name had\nto be edited to remove the ERR number at the start of the name. This had\ncaused problems for downstream programs such as Picard for marking\noptical duplicates.\n\n\nWe have used 4 Blood samples (8 paired-end (PE) \n*.fastq.gz\n files) and 5 Liver\nsamples (10 PE \n*.fastq.gz\n files) data from this study to perform the\nwhole genome alignment using the BWA aligner. The whole process took\n>150K CPU seconds per sample and the precomputed alignment will be used\nin different sections of this workshop.\n\n\n\n\nPrepare the Environment\n\u00b6\n\n\nBy now you know about the raw sequence FASTQ format generated by the\nIllumina sequencers. Next we will see how FASTQ files are aligned to\nthe reference genome and what the resulting standard alignment\nformat is. In the interest of time, we have selected only 1 million paired\nreads from a \nBlood\n sample to demonstrate a \nBWA\n command. The remaining\nalignments have already been performed for you and will be required in\nthe subsequent modules of the workshop.\n\n\nThe input data for this section can be found in the \nalignment\n\ndirectory on your desktop. Please follow the commands below to go to the\nright folder and view the top 10 lines of the input FASTQ file:\n\n\nOpen the Terminal.\n\n\nFirst, go to the right folder, where the data are stored.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\ncd /home/trainee/alignment\nls\nzless input/SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset_R1.fastq.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress \nq\n to stop the \nzless\n command.\n\n\n\n\nOverview of the Process\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1:\n A flow diagram showing the steps that will be performed in this practical. \n\n\n\n\nAlignment\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou already know that there are a number of competing tools for short\nread alignment, each with its own set of strengths, weaknesses, and\ncaveats. Here we will use \nBWA\n, a widely used aligner based on the\nBurrows-Wheeler Algorithm. The alignment involves two steps:  \n\n\n1) Indexing the genome.\n\n2) Running the alignment command.  \n\n\nBWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large\nreference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three\nalgorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first algorithm is\ndesigned for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while the other two are for\nlonger sequences ranging from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share\nsimilar features such as long-read support and split alignment, but\nBWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended for high-quality\nqueries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has better\nperformance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads. For more details see\nthe \nBWA manual\n.\n\n\nBWA has a number of parameters in order to perform the alignment. To\nview them all, type\n\n\n1\nbwa <press enter>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBWA uses an indexed genome for the alignment in order to keep its memory\nfootprint small. Indexing a genome is similar in concept to indexing a book.\nIf you want to know on which page a certain word appears or a chapter begins,\nit is much more efficient/faster to look it up in a pre-built index than going\nthrough every page of the book until you find it. Indices allow the aligner to narrow\ndown the potential origin of a query sequence within the genome, saving both time and memory.  \n\n\nDue to time constraints, we will \nNOT\n be running the\nindexing command. It is run only once for a version of a genome, and the\ncomplete command to index the human genome version hg19 is given below.\n\n\n\n\nSTOP\n\n\nYou \nDO NOT\n need to run this command. This has already been run for you.\n\n\nbwa index -p bwaIndex/human_g1k_v37.fasta -a bwtsw human_g1k_v37.fasta\n\n\n\n\nWe have used the following arguments for the indexing of the genome.\n\n\n\n\n-p\n:  Prefix of the output database [same as db filename].  \n\n\n-a\n:  Algorithm for constructing BWT index. This method works with the\n    whole human genome.\n\n\nRef genome filename\n: the last argument is the name of the reference genome\nfile in the fasta format.\n\n\n\n\nThis command will output 6 files that constitute the index. These files\nhave the prefix \nhuman_g1k_v37.fasta\n and are stored in the \nbwaIndex\n\nsubdirectory. To view the precomputed index files, type:\n\n\n1\nls -l bwaIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that the genome is indexed we can move on to the actual alignment.  \n\n\nMake a directory to store the output from your aligner.\n\n\n1\nmkdir outputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument for \nbwa\n is the basename of the index for the genome\nto be searched. In our case this is \nhuman_g1k_v37.fasta\n.\n\n\nAlign the reads from the \nBlood\n sample using the following command:\n\n\n1\nbwa mem -M -t 4 -R '@RG\\tSM:Blood\\tID:ERR059356.subset\\tLB:lb\\tPL:ILLUMINA' bwaIndex/human_g1k_v37.fasta input/SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset_R1.fastq.gz input/SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset_R2.fastq.gz > outputs/SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset.sam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above command outputs the alignment in SAM format and stores them in\nthe file \nSM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset.sam\n in the subdirectory \noutputs\n.\n\n\nWe have used the following arguments for the alignment of the reads.\n\n\n\n\nmem\n: fast mode of high quality input such the Illumina\n\n\n-M\n: flags extra hits as secondary. This is needed for compatibility with\n  other tools downstream.\n\n\n-t\n: Number of threads.\n\n\n-R\n: Complete read group header line.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nSAM (Sequence Alignment/Map)\n\nformat is currently the de facto standard for storing large nucleotide\nsequence alignments. It is a TAB-delimited text format consisting of a header section, which is\noptional, and an alignment section. If present, the header must be prior\nto the alignments. Header lines start with \n@\n, while alignment lines do\nnot. Each alignment line has 11 mandatory fields with essential alignment\ninformation such as mapping position.\n\n\nNavigate into your \noutputs\n directory and look at the top 10 lines of the SAM file by typing:\n\n\n1\n2\ncd outputs\nhead -n 10 SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset.sam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nCan you distinguish between the header of the SAM format and the actual\nalignments?\n\n\nAnswer\nThe header line starts with the letter \u2018@\u2019 i.e.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n@SQ SN:GL000192.1   LN:547496\n@RG SM:Blood    ID:ERR059356    LB:lb   PL:ILLUMINA\n@PG ID:bwa  PN:bwa  VN:0.7.15-r1140 CL:bwa mem -M -t 4 -R @RG\\tSM:Blood\\tID:ERR059356.subset\\tLB:lb\\tPL:ILLUMINA bwaIndex/human_g1k_v37.fasta input/SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset_R1.fastq.gz input/SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset_R2.fastq.gz\n\n\n\nThe actual alignments start with read ID i.e.\n\n\n1\n2\nHWI-ST478_0133:3:1101:1374:2056#0   147 11\nHWI-ST478_0133:3:1101:1352:2070#0   163 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nWhat kind of information does the header provide?\n\n\nAnswer\n@HD: Header line; VN: Format version; SO: the sort order of\n    alignments.\n@SQ: Reference sequence information; SN: reference sequence name;\n    LN: reference sequence length.\n@PG: Program; ID: Program record identifier; VN: Program\n    version; CL: the command line that produces the alignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nTo which chromosome are the reads mapped?\n\n\nAnswer\nAll chromosomes are represented (look at the 3\nrd\n field).\n\ngrep -v \u201c^@\u201d SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset.sam  | cut -f3 | sort | uniq\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManipulating SAM output\n\u00b6\n\n\nSAM files are rather big and when dealing with a high volume of NGS\ndata, storage space can become an issue. As we have already seen, we can\nconvert SAM to BAM files (their binary equivalent that are not human\nreadable) that occupy much less space.\n\n\nConvert SAM to BAM using \nsamtools view\n and store the output in the\nfile \nSM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset.bam\n. You have to instruct \nsamtools view\n that the input\nis in SAM format (\n-S\n), the output should be in BAM format (\n-b\n) and\nthat you want the output to be stored in the file specified by the \n-o\n\noption:\n\n\n1\nsamtools view -bSo SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset.bam SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset.sam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBAM files are not human-readable but can be viewed with the \nsamtools view\n command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced exercise\nCompute summary stats for the Flag values associated with the alignments\n using:\n \n1\nsamtools flagstat SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset.bam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Alignment Visualisation option\n\u00b6\n\n\nIGV is a stand-alone genome browser that can be used to visualise the\nBAM outputs. Please check their \nwebsite\n\nfor all the formats that IGV can display.\n\n\nWe will be using IGV later in the workshop for viewing a BAM file in the\ngenome browser. It requires the index of the BAM file to be in the same\nfolder as where the BAM file is. The index file should have the same\nname as the BAM file and the suffix \n.bai\n. Finally, to create the index\nof a BAM file you need to make sure that the file is sorted according to\nchromosomal coordinates.\n\n\nSort alignments according to chromosomal position and store the result\nin the file with the prefix \nSM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset.sorted\n:\n\n\n1\nsamtools sort SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset.bam SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset.sorted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex the sorted file.\n\n\n1\nsamtools index SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset.sorted.bam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe indexing will create a file called \nSM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset.sorted.bam.bai\n. Note that\nyou don\u2019t have to specify the name of the index file when running\n\nsamtools index\n, it simply appends a \n.bai\n suffix to the input BAM\nfile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nHow can you quickly find out whether a BAM file is already coordinate\nsorted or not?\n\n\nAnswer\nUse \nsamtools view -h\n command to look at the SAM header.\nIt will have an SO field (e.g. SO:coordinate)",

Header lines start with  @ , while alignment lines do\nnot. Each alignment line has 11 mandatory fields with essential alignment\ninformation such as mapping position.  Navigate into your  outputs  directory and look at the top 10 lines of the SAM file by typing:  1\n2 cd outputs\nhead -n 10 SM_Blood_ID_ERR059356.subset.sam     Question  Can you distinguish between the header of the SAM format and the actual\nalignments?

We will\nfocus only on whole genome data and provide command lines that allow\ndetecting Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV). This workshop will show you\nhow to launch individual steps of a complete DNA-Seq SNV pipeline using\ncancer data.\n\n\nIn the second part of the tutorial we will also be using IGV to\nvisualise and manually inspect candidate variant calls.\n\n\n\n\nPrepare the Environment\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe will use a dataset derived from whole genome sequencing of a\n33-yr-old lung adenocarcinoma patient, who is a never-smoker and has no\nfamilial cancer history.\n\n\nThe data consists of whole genome sequencing of liver metastatic lung\ncancer (frozen), primary lung cancer (FFPE) and blood tissue of a lung\nadenocarcinoma patient (AK55).\n\n\nOpen the Terminal and go to the \nsnv\n working directory:\n\n\n1\ncd /home/trainee/snv/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll commands entered into the terminal for this tutorial should be from\nwithin the \nsnv\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nThe BAM alignment files are contained in the subdirectory called\n\nalignment\n and are located in the following subdirectories:\n\n\n\n\nnormal/normal.sorted.bam\n and \nnormal/normal.sorted.bam.bai\n\n\ntumour/tumor.sorted.bam\n and \ntumour/tumour.sorted.bam.bai\n\n\n\n\nCheck that the \nalignment\n directory contains the above-mentioned files by typing:\n\n\n1\nls -l alignment/*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese files are based on subsetting the whole genomes derived from blood\nand liver metastases to the first 10Mb of chromosome 4. This will allow\nour analyses to run in a sufficient time during the workshop, but it\u2019s\nworth being aware that this is less < 0.5% of the genome which\nhighlights the length of time and resources required to perform cancer\ngenomics on full genomes!\n\n\nThe initial structure of your folders should look like this (type \nls -l\n):\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n-- alignment/             # bam files\n  -- normal/                # The blood sample directory containing bam files\n  -- tumour/                # The tumour sample directory containing bam files\n-- ref/                   # Contains reference genome files      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we need to set some environment variables to save typing lengthy\nfile paths over and over.

By itself, this information is not much use to us unless there\nis a specific genomic location we are interested in. Generally, we next\nwant to annotate these variants to determine whether they impact any\ngenes and if so what is their level of impact (e.g. are they causing a\npremature stop codon gain or are they likely less harmful missense\nmutations).\n\n\nThe sections above have dealt with calling somatic variants from the\nfirst 10Mb of chromosome 4. This is important in finding variants that\nare unique to the tumour sample(s) and may have driven both tumour\ngrowth and/or metastasis. An important secondary question is whether the\ngermline genome of the patient contains any variants that may have\ncontributed to the development of the initial tumour through\npredisposing the patient to cancer. These variants \nmay not\n be captured\nby somatic variant analysis as their allele frequency may not change in\nthe tumour genome compared with the normal.\n\n\nFor this section, we will use \nall\n variants from the first 60Mb of\nchromosome 5 that have been pre-generated using the GATK \nHaplotypeCaller\n\nvariant caller on both the normal and tumour genomes. The output of this\nwas GVCF files which were fed into GATK \nGenotypeGVCFs\n to produce a\nmerged VCF file. We will use this pre-generated file as we are primarily\ninterested in the annotation of variants rather than their generation.\nThe annotation method we will use is called \nVariant Effect Predictor\n\nor \nVEP\n for short and is available from Ensembl \nhere\n.\n\n\n\nOur pre-generated VCF file is located in the \nvariants\n folder.

In a typical whole cancer genome,\nyou will have about 4-5 million variants, and therefore rows, in a VCF\nfile which takes up gigabytes of space. In our small example, we have\njust 100,000 variants which is already too large to make any kind of\nmeaningful sense out of by just opening up the VCF file in a text\neditor. We need a solution that allows us to perform intelligent queries\non our variants to search this mass of noise for the signal we are\ninterested in.\n\n\nLuckily, such a free tool exists and is called \nGEMINI\n. \nGEMINI\n takes as\nan input your annotated VCF file and creates a database file which it\ncan then query using Structured Query Language (SQL) commands. Not only\ndoes \nGEMINI\n make your variants easily searchable, it also brings in many\nexternal annotations to add more information about your variants (such\nas their frequencies in international databases).\n\n\nTo get started with \nGEMINI\n, let\u2019s make a database out of our annotated\nVCF file.\n\n\n1\ngemini load -v variants/HC.chr5.60Mb.vep.vcf --cores 4 --skip-gerp-bp --skip-cadd -t VEP variants/HC.chr5.60Mb.vep.vcf.db\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will take approximately 10 minutes. You will see a few errors due\nto multiallelic sites, normally these sites are decomposed and\nnormalized before creating the \nGEMINI\n database but this is outside the\nscope of this workshop.\n\n\nOnce the database has been created let\u2019s run a basic query to see what\nkind of information we get out of \nGEMINI\n.\n\n\n1\ngemini\n \nquery\n \n-\nq\n \n\"SELECT *, (gts).(*), (gt_types).(*), (gt_depths).(*), (gt_ref_depths).(*), (gt_alt_depths).(*), (gt_quals).(*) FROM variants LIMIT 10;\"\n \n--header variants/HC.chr5.60Mb.vep.vcf.db\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will output a bunch of ordered information for your query to the\ncommand line, this is usually saved to a TSV file and opened in a\nspreadsheet as we will do for the next query. In the mean time, let\u2019s\ndissect this query to understand the syntax we need to use to filter our\nvariants. First, we have a SELECT statement which simply specifies that\nwe want to select data from the database. The following comma-separated\nvalues are the columns that we want to output from the database, in this\ncase we are selecting all columns with the star character and then all\nsub-columns for each sample with the other values. Then, we have a \u201cFROM\nvariants\u201d statement which is specifying the table within the database\nthat we want to fetch information from. Finally, the \u201cLIMIT 10\u201d\nstatement specifies that no more than 10 rows should be returned. In\nsummary then, we are asking for all columns for 10 rows from the table\n\nvariants\n. If you haven\u2019t used SQL before don\u2019t worry, the \nGEMINI\n\nwebsite is very helpful and provides many examples for how to query your\ndatabase.\n\n\nLet\u2019s now perform a more interesting query to find variants that have a\nmedium or high impact on a gene and are rare or not present in existing\ninternational allele frequency databases. We will save the output of\nthis query to a file and open it up in a spreadsheet.\n\n\n1\ngemini\n \nquery\n \n-\nq\n \n\"SELECT *, (gts).(*), (gt_types).(*), (gt_depths).(*), (gt_ref_depths).(*), (gt_alt_depths).(*), (gt_quals).(*) FROM variants WHERE (impact_severity = 'HIGH' OR impact_severity = 'MED') AND (aaf_1kg_all < 0.01 OR aaf_1kg_all is null) AND (aaf_esp_all < 0.01 OR aaf_esp_all is null) AND (aaf_exac_all < 0.01 OR aaf_exac_all is null);\"\n \n--header variants/HC.chr5.60Mb.vep.vcf.db > variants/gemini-result.tsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we have added a WHERE statement which restricts the rows\nthat are returned based on values that we specify for specific columns.\nHere, we are asking to return variants where their impact on the gene\n(impact_severity column) is medium or high and the allele frequency in\n1000Genomes, ESP and EXaC is less than 1% or the variant is not present\nin any of these databases.\n\n\nNow let\u2019s open the result in a spreadsheet to look at the annotations:\n\n\n1\nlibreoffice --calc variants/gemini-result.tsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTick the \u201cTab\u201d under \u201cSeparated by\u201d on the dialog window that comes up.  \n\n\nYou can see that the first 14 columns contain information on the variant\nincluding its location, ref, alt, dbSNP ID, quality and type. Slowly\nscroll to the right and look at the columns of data that are provided.\nMost importantly, column BD includes the gene this variant impacts, BN\nthe impact itself and BP the impact severity. Scroll towards the end of\nthe spreadsheet until you get to columns ED and EE, these contain the\ngenotype for each of the samples. Columns EH and EI contain the total\ndepth for each variant in each sample and the 4 following columns\ncontain the reference and alternate depths for each sample. Finally,\ncolumns EN and EO contain the genotype qualities (from the GQ field in\nthe VCF) for each sample. As you scroll back and forth through this\nspreadsheet, you will see that \nGEMINI\n brings in information from a\nvariety of sources including: OMIM, ClinVar, GERP, PolyPhen 2, SIFT,\nESP, 1000 Genomes, ExAC, ENCODE, CADD and more! We are only looking at a\nsmall number of variants from the start of a chromosome so not many of\nthese annotations will be present but in a full genome database they are\nincredibly useful.\n\n\nGEMINI\n allows you to filter your variants based on any column that you\nsee in this results file. For example, you may want all variants in a\nspecific gene, in which case you would simply add \u201cWHERE gene = \u2019BRCA1\u2019\u201d\nto your query.

A full description of the\nflags can be found in the  SAM specification .  Another useful bit of information in the SAM is the CIGAR string. It\u2019s\nthe 6 th  column in the file.  This column explains how the alignment was achieved.   M == base aligns  but doesn\u2019t have to be a match.  A SNP will have an M even if it disagrees with the reference. \nI == Insertion \nD == Deletion \nS == soft-clips. These are handy to find un removed adapters, viral insertions, etc.   An in-depth explanation of the CIGAR can be found  here .\nThe exact details of the CIGAR string can be found in the SAM specification as\nwell.

Answer This makes it easier for downstream analysis tools. For NGS analysis, the convention is to left align indels. This is only really needed when calling variants with legacy locus-based\ntools such as samtools or GATK UnifiedGenotyper. Otherwise you will have\nworse performance and accuracy.

Another method is to use a kmer approach: Take a part of both ends of the fragment. Build a hash table. Count the similar hits. Brute force, compare all the sequences.   \nHere we will use  Picard \u2018s approach:  Normal Sample:\n   1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8 $JAVA7   - Xmx2G   - jar   $ { PICARD_JAR }   MarkDuplicates   \\ \n   REMOVE_DUPLICATES = false   \\ \n   CREATE_MD5_FILE = true   \\ \n   VALIDATION_STRINGENCY = SILENT   \\ \n   CREATE_INDEX = true   \\ \n   INPUT = alignment / normal / normal . matefixed . bam   \\ \n   OUTPUT = alignment / normal / normal . sorted . dup . bam   \\ \n   METRICS_FILE = alignment / normal / normal . sorted . dup . metrics    Tumour Sample: \n   1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8 $JAVA7   - Xmx2G   - jar   $ { PICARD_JAR }   MarkDuplicates   \\ \n   REMOVE_DUPLICATES = false   \\ \n   CREATE_MD5_FILE = true   \\ \n   VALIDATION_STRINGENCY = SILENT   \\ \n   CREATE_INDEX = true   \\ \n   INPUT = alignment / tumour / tumour . matefixed . bam   \\ \n   OUTPUT = alignment / tumour / tumour . sorted . dup . bam   \\ \n   METRICS_FILE = alignment / tumour / tumour . sorted . dup . metrics    \nWe can look in the metrics output to see what happened.  1 less alignment/normal/normal.sorted.dup.metrics    Question  What percent of reads are duplicates?  Answer 0.046996%    Question  Often, we have multiple libraries and when this occurs separate measures\nare calculated for each library. Why is it important to not combine everything?  Answer Each library represents a set of different DNA fragments. Each library involves different PCR reactions PCR duplicates can not occur between fragments of two different\nlibraries. However, similar fragments could be found between\nlibraries when the coverage is high.",

By itself, this information is not much use to us unless there\nis a specific genomic location we are interested in. Generally, we next\nwant to annotate these variants to determine whether they impact any\ngenes and if so what is their level of impact (e.g. are they causing a\npremature stop codon gain or are they likely less harmful missense\nmutations).  The sections above have dealt with calling somatic variants from the\nfirst 10Mb of chromosome 4. This is important in finding variants that\nare unique to the tumour sample(s) and may have driven both tumour\ngrowth and/or metastasis. An important secondary question is whether the\ngermline genome of the patient contains any variants that may have\ncontributed to the development of the initial tumour through\npredisposing the patient to cancer. These variants  may not  be captured\nby somatic variant analysis as their allele frequency may not change in\nthe tumour genome compared with the normal.

To get started with  GEMINI , let\u2019s make a database out of our annotated\nVCF file.  1 gemini load -v variants/HC.chr5.60Mb.vep.vcf --cores 4 --skip-gerp-bp --skip-cadd -t VEP variants/HC.chr5.60Mb.vep.vcf.db   This will take approximately 10 minutes. You will see a few errors due\nto multiallelic sites, normally these sites are decomposed and\nnormalized before creating the  GEMINI  database but this is outside the\nscope of this workshop.  Once the database has been created let\u2019s run a basic query to see what\nkind of information we get out of  GEMINI .  1 gemini   query   - q   \"SELECT *, (gts).(*), (gt_types).(*), (gt_depths).(*), (gt_ref_depths).(*), (gt_alt_depths).(*), (gt_quals).(*) FROM variants LIMIT 10;\"   --header variants/HC.chr5.60Mb.vep.vcf.db    This will output a bunch of ordered information for your query to the\ncommand line, this is usually saved to a TSV file and opened in a\nspreadsheet as we will do for the next query. In the mean time, let\u2019s\ndissect this query to understand the syntax we need to use to filter our\nvariants. First, we have a SELECT statement which simply specifies that\nwe want to select data from the database. The following comma-separated\nvalues are the columns that we want to output from the database, in this\ncase we are selecting all columns with the star character and then all\nsub-columns for each sample with the other values. Then, we have a \u201cFROM\nvariants\u201d statement which is specifying the table within the database\nthat we want to fetch information from. Finally, the \u201cLIMIT 10\u201d\nstatement specifies that no more than 10 rows should be returned. In\nsummary then, we are asking for all columns for 10 rows from the table variants . If you haven\u2019t used SQL before don\u2019t worry, the  GEMINI \nwebsite is very helpful and provides many examples for how to query your\ndatabase.  Let\u2019s now perform a more interesting query to find variants that have a\nmedium or high impact on a gene and are rare or not present in existing\ninternational allele frequency databases. We will save the output of\nthis query to a file and open it up in a spreadsheet.  1 gemini   query   - q   \"SELECT *, (gts).(*), (gt_types).(*), (gt_depths).(*), (gt_ref_depths).(*), (gt_alt_depths).(*), (gt_quals).(*) FROM variants WHERE (impact_severity = 'HIGH' OR impact_severity = 'MED') AND (aaf_1kg_all < 0.01 OR aaf_1kg_all is null) AND (aaf_esp_all < 0.01 OR aaf_esp_all is null) AND (aaf_exac_all < 0.01 OR aaf_exac_all is null);\"   --header variants/HC.chr5.60Mb.vep.vcf.db > variants/gemini-result.tsv    Notice that we have added a WHERE statement which restricts the rows\nthat are returned based on values that we specify for specific columns.\nHere, we are asking to return variants where their impact on the gene\n(impact_severity column) is medium or high and the allele frequency in\n1000Genomes, ESP and EXaC is less than 1% or the variant is not present\nin any of these databases.  Now let\u2019s open the result in a spreadsheet to look at the annotations:  1 libreoffice --calc variants/gemini-result.tsv   Tick the \u201cTab\u201d under \u201cSeparated by\u201d on the dialog window that comes up.    You can see that the first 14 columns contain information on the variant\nincluding its location, ref, alt, dbSNP ID, quality and type. Slowly\nscroll to the right and look at the columns of data that are provided.\nMost importantly, column BD includes the gene this variant impacts, BN\nthe impact itself and BP the impact severity. Scroll towards the end of\nthe spreadsheet until you get to columns ED and EE, these contain the\ngenotype for each of the samples. Columns EH and EI contain the total\ndepth for each variant in each sample and the 4 following columns\ncontain the reference and alternate depths for each sample. Finally,\ncolumns EN and EO contain the genotype qualities (from the GQ field in\nthe VCF) for each sample. As you scroll back and forth through this\nspreadsheet, you will see that  GEMINI  brings in information from a\nvariety of sources including: OMIM, ClinVar, GERP, PolyPhen 2, SIFT,\nESP, 1000 Genomes, ExAC, ENCODE, CADD and more! We are only looking at a\nsmall number of variants from the start of a chromosome so not many of\nthese annotations will be present but in a full genome database they are\nincredibly useful.  GEMINI  allows you to filter your variants based on any column that you\nsee in this results file. For example, you may want all variants in a\nspecific gene, in which case you would simply add \u201cWHERE gene = \u2019BRCA1\u2019\u201d\nto your query.

These files contain just the first\n60Mb of chromosome 5 but contain several examples of inferred copy\nnumber events to enable interpretation and visualisation of the copy\nnumber variation that is present in entire cancer genomes. \nSequenza\n is\nthe tool we will use to perform this analysis. It consists of two\n\nPython\n pre-processing steps followed by a third step in \nR\n to infer the\ndepth ratio, cellularity, ploidy and to plot the results for\ninterpretation.\n\n\nIn the second part of the tutorial we will also be using \nIGV\n to\nvisualise and manually inspect the copy number variation we inferred in\nthe first part for validation purposes. This section will also include a\ndiscussion on the importance of good quality data by highlighting the\ninadequacies of the workshop dataset and the implications this has on\nanalysis results.\n\n\n\n\nPrepare the Environment\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe will use a dataset derived from whole genome sequencing of a\n33-yr-old lung adenocarcinoma patient, who is a never-smoker and has no\nfamilial cancer history.\n\n\nThe data files are contained in the subdirectory called \ndata\n and are\nthe following:\n\n\n\n\nnormal.chr5.60Mb.bam\n and \nnormal.chr5.60Mb.bam.bai\n\n\ntumour.chr5.60Mb.bam\n and \ntumour.chr5.60Mb.bam.bai\n\n\n\n\n\nThese files are based on subsetting the whole genomes derived from \nblood\n\nand \nliver metastases\n to the first 60Mb of chromosome 5. This will allow\nour analyses to run in a sufficient time during the workshop, but it\u2019s\nworth being aware that we are analysing just 1.9% of the genome which\nwill highlight the length of time and resources required to perform\ncancer genomics on full genomes!\n\n\nOpen the Terminal and go to the \ncnv\n working directory:\n\n\n1\ncd /home/trainee/cnv/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll commands entered into the terminal for this tutorial should be from\nwithin the \ncnv\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nCheck that the \ndata\n directory contains the above-mentioned files by\ntyping:\n\n\n1\nls -l data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequenza CNV Analysis\n\u00b6\n\n\nSequenza is run in three steps. The first pre-processing step is run on\nthe final normal and tumour mapped data (BAM files) in order to walk the\ngenome in a pileup format (automatically generated by \nsamtools\n). This\nfirst step finds high quality sites in the genomes and extracts their\ndepth and genotype in the normal genome and calculates the variant\nalleles and allele frequencies in the tumour genome. The second step is\nto perform a binning on these sites to save space and analysis time in\nthe third step. Finally, the third step is run in \nR\n to normalise the depth\nratio between the normal/tumour genomes, infer cellularity and ploidy\nand graphically output results for interpretation.\n\n\nStep 1: Pre-processing \u2013 Walking the Genome\n\u00b6\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\npypy software/sequenza/sequenza-utils.py bam2seqz \\\n-n data/normal.chr5.60Mb.bam \\\n-t data/tumour.chr5.60Mb.bam \\\n--fasta assets/human_g1k_v37.fasta \\\n-gc assets/human_g1k_v37.gc50Base.txt.gz \\\n-C 5:1-60000000 | gzip > stage1.seqz.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\nPress tab after typing a few characters of a directory of filename to\nauto-complete the rest.

You should see the top line being the command \u2019pypy\u2019 with\na % CPU usage of 98/99%. Press \nq\n to quit out of this process view and go\nback to the tab running \nSequenza\n. \nIf everything is running correctly, it\nwill take approximately 40 minutes to run\n.

This estimate is based on the B allele frequency and\ndepth ratio through the genome and is an important metric to know for\ninterpretation of Sequenza results and for other analyses. Lets look at\nthe cellularity estimate for our analysis by opening\n\nCanGenWorkshop_model_fit.pdf\n with the command:\n\n\n1\nevince sequenza_results/CanGenWorkshop_model_fit.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cellularity estimate is at the top along with the average ploidy\nestimate and the standard deviation of the B allele frequency. We can\nsee that the cellularity has been estimated at 24% which is fairly low\nand we will see why this is bad in the next section on CNV\nvisualisation. The ploidy value of 2.1 indicates this piece of the\ngenome is not hugely amplified or deleted and the BAF standard deviation\nindicates there are no significant long losses of heterozygosity.\n\n\nClose the PDF window to resume the Terminal prompt.\n\n\nLet\u2019s now look at the CNV inferences through our genomic block. Open the\ngenome copy number visualisation file with:\n\n\n1\nevince sequenza_results/CanGenWorkshop_genome_view.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis file contains three \u201cpages\u201d of copy number events through the\nentire genomic block.\n\n\n\n\nThe first page shows copy numbers of the A (red) and B (blue) alleles,\n\n\nThe second page shows overall copy number changes, and\n\n\nThe third page shows the B allele frequency and depth ratio through\ngenomic block.  \n\n\n\n\nLooking at the overall copy number changes, we see that\nour block is at a copy number of 2 with a small duplication to copy\nnumber 4 about \u2153 of the way through the block and another just after\nhalfway through the block. There is also a reduction in copy number to 1\ncopy about \u2158 of the way through the block. The gap that you see just\nbefore this reduction in copy number is the chromosomal centromere - an\narea that is notoriously difficult to sequence so always ends up in a\ngap with short read data.\n\n\nYou can see how this is a very easy to read output and lets you\nimmediately see the frequency and severity of copy number events through\nyour genome. Let\u2019s compare the small genomic block we ran with the same\noutput from the entire genome which has been pre-computed for you. This\nis located in the \npre_generated/results_whole_genome\n folder and\ncontains the same 13 output files as for the small genomic block. As\nbefore, let\u2019s look at the cellularity estimate with:\n\n\n1\nevince pre_generated/results_whole_genome/CanGenWorkshop_model_fit.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt now looks like it\u2019s even worse at just 16%! A change is to be\nexpected as we were only analysing 1.9% of the genome. Let\u2019s now look at\nthe whole genome copy number profile with:\n\n\n1\nevince pre_generated/results_whole_genome/CanGenWorkshop_genome_view.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that there are a number of copy number events across the\ngenome and our genomic block (the first 60Mb of chromosome 5) is\ninferred as mostly copy number 4 followed by a reduction to copy number\n2, rather than 2 to 1 as we saw in the output we generated. The reason\nfor this is that \nSequenza\n uses the genome-wide depth ratio and BAF in\norder to estimate copy number, if you ask it to analyse a small block\nmostly at copy number 4 with a small reduction to copy number 2, the\nmost likely scenario in lieu of more data is that this is a copy number\n2 block with a reduction to 1. It\u2019s important to carefully examine the\ncellularity, ploidy and BAF estimates of your sample along with the\nplots of model fit (\nCanGenWorkshop_model_fit.pdf\n) and\ncellularity/ploidy contours (\nCanGenWorkshop_CP_contours.pdf\n) in order\nto decide if you believe Sequenza\u2019s inference of the copy numbers. Have\na look at these for yourself if you want to get a better idea of how\n\nSequenza\n makes its inferences and conclusions.\n\n\n\n\nCNV Visualisation/Confirmation in IGV\n\u00b6\n\n\nLet\u2019s see if we can visualise one of the CNV events where copy number\nincreased significantly. We\u2019ll focus on the copy number 4 event seen at\nabout \u2153 of the way through the \nCanGenWorkshop_genome_view.pdf\n output\nwe generated. First, we need to find the coordinates that have been\npredicted for this event. Have a look at the \nCanGenWorkshop_segments.txt\n\nfile in the results folder to view all predicted CNV events with:\n\n\n1\nless sequenza_results/CanGenWorkshop_segments.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is only one at a copy number of 4 (CNt column) and it starts at\n21,051,700 to 21,522,065 which is 470kb and corresponds to the small block\nwe see in the genome view PDF.\n\n\nQuit out of viewing the segments file by pressing \nq\n.\n\n\nWe will now open \nIGV\n and see if we can observe the predicted increase in\ncopy number within these genomic coordinates.\n\n\n1\n/home/trainee/snv/Applications/igv/igv.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIGV will take 30 seconds or so to open so just be patient.\n\n\n\nFor a duplication of this size, we will not be able to easily observe it\njust by looking at the raw read alignments. In order to see it we will\ngenerate two tiled data files (TDFs) within IGV which contain the\naverage read depth for a given window size through the genome. This\nmeans that we can aggregate the average read depth over relatively large\nchunks of the genome and compare these values between the normal and\ntumour genomes.\n\n\nTo begin, we will go to \nTools\n then \nRun igvtools...\n in the IGV\nmenubar. Specify the normal bam file (under \ncnv\n then \ndata\n) as the\ninput file and change the window size to 100,000 (one hundred thousand).\nThen press the \nRun\n button and IGV will make the TDF file. This takes\nabout 5 minutes. \nRepeat this for the tumour genome.\n\n\nAfter you have both TDF files, go to \nFile\n and \nLoad from file...\n in\nthe menubar and select the BAM and TDF files to open. Once you have\nopened them, they will appear as tracks along with the BAM tracks we\nloaded initially. Navigate to the genomic coordinates of our event\n(5:21,051,700-21,522,065) by typing it in the coordinate box at the top.\nMouse over the two blue tracks to get the average depth values for the\n100,000 bp windows. What you should see is that the liverMets sample has\n3-6X more coverage than the Blood sample for the four windows that cover\nthis region.\n\n\nThis may seem a bit underwhelming, after all, wasn\u2019t the increase of the\nregion to a copy number of 4, i.e. we expect a doubling of reads in the\ntumour? To explain why we are only seeing such a small coverage\nincrease, we need to turn to our good friend mathematics!\n\n\nImagine we have two 30X genomes for the normal and tumour samples and\nthe tumour is at 100% purity. If there is a copy number increase to 4 in\nthe tumour from 2 in the normal, the duplicated segment should indeed\nhave twice as many reads as the same segment in the normal genome. Now,\nlets imagine the tumour genome was only at a purity of 50% (i.e. it\ncontains 50% normal cells and 50% tumour cells). Now, half of the\nduplicated \u201ctumour genome\u201d segment will be at a copy number of 2 and\nhalf will be at 4. What does this mean when we sequence them as a\nmixture? The resulting average copy number of the block will be\n\n(0.5*2)+(0.5*4) = 3\n. Now what if we only have 16% tumour cells in our\n\u201ctumour genome\u201d? This will be \n(0.84*2)+(0.16*4) = 2.32\n. You can see\nhow sequencing a low cellularity tumour at a low depth makes it much\nharder to infer copy number variations!\n\n\nReturning to our genomes at hand, when we previously looked at the\ncellularity estimate of this tumour we saw it was 20% from the small\nblock we ran or 16% from the whole genome. Thus, the read depth increase\nof just 3-6X (about 10-20% more reads) in this segment is not\nsurprising. A low cellularity tumour greatly reduces our power to infer\ncopy number events as relatively small changes in depth can occur by\nchance in the genome and these can be mis-identified as copy number\nchanges. As well as this, it reduces our power for other analyses since\nwe must also remember that a tumour can itself contain multiple clones\nwhich have to share just 16% of reads.\n\n\nIt is possible to sequence through a low-cellularity sample when, for\nexample, there is no way to take another sample (as is the case of most\nbiopsies). \u201cSequencing through\u201d means to simply sequence the tumour at a\nmuch higher coverage, usually 90-120X. This will mean that there will be\na net increase in reads supplying evidence for copy number events and\nvariants and in aggregate these will still retain power to infer these\nevents when using tools that look at the whole genome like Sequenza\ndoes.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nF.

To ensure reasonable analysis times, we will perform the analysis on a\nheavily subsetted pair of BAM files. These files contain just the first\n60Mb of chromosome 5 but contain several examples of inferred copy\nnumber events to enable interpretation and visualisation of the copy\nnumber variation that is present in entire cancer genomes.  Sequenza  is\nthe tool we will use to perform this analysis. It consists of two Python  pre-processing steps followed by a third step in  R  to infer the\ndepth ratio, cellularity, ploidy and to plot the results for\ninterpretation.  In the second part of the tutorial we will also be using  IGV  to\nvisualise and manually inspect the copy number variation we inferred in\nthe first part for validation purposes. This section will also include a\ndiscussion on the importance of good quality data by highlighting the\ninadequacies of the workshop dataset and the implications this has on\nanalysis results.",

This estimate is based on the B allele frequency and\ndepth ratio through the genome and is an important metric to know for\ninterpretation of Sequenza results and for other analyses. Lets look at\nthe cellularity estimate for our analysis by opening CanGenWorkshop_model_fit.pdf  with the command:  1 evince sequenza_results/CanGenWorkshop_model_fit.pdf   \nThe cellularity estimate is at the top along with the average ploidy\nestimate and the standard deviation of the B allele frequency. We can\nsee that the cellularity has been estimated at 24% which is fairly low\nand we will see why this is bad in the next section on CNV\nvisualisation. The ploidy value of 2.1 indicates this piece of the\ngenome is not hugely amplified or deleted and the BAF standard deviation\nindicates there are no significant long losses of heterozygosity.  Close the PDF window to resume the Terminal prompt.  Let\u2019s now look at the CNV inferences through our genomic block. Open the\ngenome copy number visualisation file with:  1 evince sequenza_results/CanGenWorkshop_genome_view.pdf   \nThis file contains three \u201cpages\u201d of copy number events through the\nentire genomic block.   The first page shows copy numbers of the A (red) and B (blue) alleles,  The second page shows overall copy number changes, and  The third page shows the B allele frequency and depth ratio through\ngenomic block.     Looking at the overall copy number changes, we see that\nour block is at a copy number of 2 with a small duplication to copy\nnumber 4 about \u2153 of the way through the block and another just after\nhalfway through the block. There is also a reduction in copy number to 1\ncopy about \u2158 of the way through the block. The gap that you see just\nbefore this reduction in copy number is the chromosomal centromere - an\narea that is notoriously difficult to sequence so always ends up in a\ngap with short read data.  You can see how this is a very easy to read output and lets you\nimmediately see the frequency and severity of copy number events through\nyour genome. Let\u2019s compare the small genomic block we ran with the same\noutput from the entire genome which has been pre-computed for you. This\nis located in the  pre_generated/results_whole_genome  folder and\ncontains the same 13 output files as for the small genomic block. As\nbefore, let\u2019s look at the cellularity estimate with:  1 evince pre_generated/results_whole_genome/CanGenWorkshop_model_fit.pdf   \nIt now looks like it\u2019s even worse at just 16%! A change is to be\nexpected as we were only analysing 1.9% of the genome. Let\u2019s now look at\nthe whole genome copy number profile with:  1 evince pre_generated/results_whole_genome/CanGenWorkshop_genome_view.pdf   \nYou can see that there are a number of copy number events across the\ngenome and our genomic block (the first 60Mb of chromosome 5) is\ninferred as mostly copy number 4 followed by a reduction to copy number\n2, rather than 2 to 1 as we saw in the output we generated. The reason\nfor this is that  Sequenza  uses the genome-wide depth ratio and BAF in\norder to estimate copy number, if you ask it to analyse a small block\nmostly at copy number 4 with a small reduction to copy number 2, the\nmost likely scenario in lieu of more data is that this is a copy number\n2 block with a reduction to 1. It\u2019s important to carefully examine the\ncellularity, ploidy and BAF estimates of your sample along with the\nplots of model fit ( CanGenWorkshop_model_fit.pdf ) and\ncellularity/ploidy contours ( CanGenWorkshop_CP_contours.pdf ) in order\nto decide if you believe Sequenza\u2019s inference of the copy numbers. Have\na look at these for yourself if you want to get a better idea of how Sequenza  makes its inferences and conclusions.",

            "text": "Let\u2019s see if we can visualise one of the CNV events where copy number\nincreased significantly. We\u2019ll focus on the copy number 4 event seen at\nabout \u2153 of the way through the  CanGenWorkshop_genome_view.pdf  output\nwe generated. First, we need to find the coordinates that have been\npredicted for this event. Have a look at the  CanGenWorkshop_segments.txt \nfile in the results folder to view all predicted CNV events with:  1 less sequenza_results/CanGenWorkshop_segments.txt   \nThere is only one at a copy number of 4 (CNt column) and it starts at\n21,051,700 to 21,522,065 which is 470kb and corresponds to the small block\nwe see in the genome view PDF.  Quit out of viewing the segments file by pressing  q .  We will now open  IGV  and see if we can observe the predicted increase in\ncopy number within these genomic coordinates.  1 /home/trainee/snv/Applications/igv/igv.sh   IGV will take 30 seconds or so to open so just be patient.  \nFor a duplication of this size, we will not be able to easily observe it\njust by looking at the raw read alignments. In order to see it we will\ngenerate two tiled data files (TDFs) within IGV which contain the\naverage read depth for a given window size through the genome. This\nmeans that we can aggregate the average read depth over relatively large\nchunks of the genome and compare these values between the normal and\ntumour genomes.  To begin, we will go to  Tools  then  Run igvtools...  in the IGV\nmenubar. Specify the normal bam file (under  cnv  then  data ) as the\ninput file and change the window size to 100,000 (one hundred thousand).\nThen press the  Run  button and IGV will make the TDF file. This takes\nabout 5 minutes.  Repeat this for the tumour genome.  After you have both TDF files, go to  File  and  Load from file...  in\nthe menubar and select the BAM and TDF files to open. Once you have\nopened them, they will appear as tracks along with the BAM tracks we\nloaded initially. Navigate to the genomic coordinates of our event\n(5:21,051,700-21,522,065) by typing it in the coordinate box at the top.\nMouse over the two blue tracks to get the average depth values for the\n100,000 bp windows. What you should see is that the liverMets sample has\n3-6X more coverage than the Blood sample for the four windows that cover\nthis region.  This may seem a bit underwhelming, after all, wasn\u2019t the increase of the\nregion to a copy number of 4, i.e. we expect a doubling of reads in the\ntumour? To explain why we are only seeing such a small coverage\nincrease, we need to turn to our good friend mathematics!  Imagine we have two 30X genomes for the normal and tumour samples and\nthe tumour is at 100% purity. If there is a copy number increase to 4 in\nthe tumour from 2 in the normal, the duplicated segment should indeed\nhave twice as many reads as the same segment in the normal genome. Now,\nlets imagine the tumour genome was only at a purity of 50% (i.e. it\ncontains 50% normal cells and 50% tumour cells). Now, half of the\nduplicated \u201ctumour genome\u201d segment will be at a copy number of 2 and\nhalf will be at 4. What does this mean when we sequence them as a\nmixture? The resulting average copy number of the block will be (0.5*2)+(0.5*4) = 3 . Now what if we only have 16% tumour cells in our\n\u201ctumour genome\u201d? This will be  (0.84*2)+(0.16*4) = 2.32 . You can see\nhow sequencing a low cellularity tumour at a low depth makes it much\nharder to infer copy number variations!  Returning to our genomes at hand, when we previously looked at the\ncellularity estimate of this tumour we saw it was 20% from the small\nblock we ran or 16% from the whole genome. Thus, the read depth increase\nof just 3-6X (about 10-20% more reads) in this segment is not\nsurprising. A low cellularity tumour greatly reduces our power to infer\ncopy number events as relatively small changes in depth can occur by\nchance in the genome and these can be mis-identified as copy number\nchanges. As well as this, it reduces our power for other analyses since\nwe must also remember that a tumour can itself contain multiple clones\nwhich have to share just 16% of reads.  It is possible to sequence through a low-cellularity sample when, for\nexample, there is no way to take another sample (as is the case of most\nbiopsies). \u201cSequencing through\u201d means to simply sequence the tumour at a\nmuch higher coverage, usually 90-120X. This will mean that there will be\na net increase in reads supplying evidence for copy number events and\nvariants and in aggregate these will still retain power to infer these\nevents when using tools that look at the whole genome like Sequenza\ndoes.",

All paired-end mapping methods heavily rely on the\ninsert size distribution. GC-content biases are important as it can\nimpact read-depths. \nDELLY\n generates read-depth ratios between tumour and\ncontrol samples. The percentage of mapped reads, singletons, duplicates\nand properly paired reads are additional metrics you should evaluate\nprior to any structural variant calling. These statistics vary largely\nby protocol and hence, it is usually best to compare multiple different\nsequencing runs using the same against each other to highlight outliers.\n\n\nIt is recommended that Picard module commands \nCollectInsertSizeMetrics\n\nand \nCollectGcBiasMetrics\n, and \nsamtools flagstat\n command be used.\n\n\n\n\nPrepare the Environment\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs a quick introduction we will do a structural variant analysis using a\nsingle immortal cancer cell line and its control genome (mortal parental\ncells). Total execution time to run the \nDELLY\n structural discovery\ncalling program for a matched normal tumour pair will vary depending on\nthe read coverage and the size of the genome. As a guide, it can take\napproximately 10 to 50 hours (translocation predictions taking the\nlongest), for a matched normal tumour pair (each 40-50x coverage)\nrunning on 2 cpus on a server with sufficient RAM.\n\n\nThe bam files we will be working on are a subset of the original WGS bam\nfiles, limited to specific chromosomal regions to speed up the analysis\nand to meet the time constraints for this practical.\n\n\nFirstly, we will use shell variables to help improve the readability of\ncommands and streamline scripting.

INFO:PE is the number of supporting paired-ends. INFO:CT refers\nconnection types (CT), which indicates the order and orientation of\npaired-end cluster mappings (e.g. 3to3 for 3\u2019 to 3\u2019 and 5to5 for 5\u2019 to\n5\u2019). Values can be 3to5, 5to3, 3to3 or 5to5. Different names exist for\nthese connection types in the literature, head-to-head inversions,\ntail-to-tail inversions, and so on. The consensus alignment quality\n(SRQ) is a score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates 100% identity to the\nreference. Nearby SNPs, InDels and micro-insertions at the breakpoint\ncan lower this score but only for mis-assemblies it should be very poor.\nDELLY currently drops consensus alignments with a score <0.8 and then\nfalls back to an \nIMPRECISE\n prediction.\n\n\nSVs are flagged as FILTER:LowQual if PE <3 OR MAPQ <20 (for\ntranslocations: PE <5 OR MAPQ <20), otherwise, the SV results in a\nFILTER:PASS. \nPRECISE\n variants will have split-read support (SR >0).\n\n\n\n\nSomatic Structural Variant Filtering\n\u00b6\n\n\nPlease note that this vcf file contains germline and somatic structural\nvariants but also false positives caused by repeat induced mis-mappings\nor incomplete reference sequences.

In this tutorial, we show you an\neasy alternative to build a circular representation of genomic data.\n\n\nFirst we need to go in the folder \nvisualization\n to do the analysis:\n\n\n1\ncd /home/trainee/visualization/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see what is in this folder:\n\n\n1\nls\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncircos.R  delly.somatic.vcf  mutect.somatic.vcf  scones.somatic.tsv\n\n\nTake a look at the data files.\n\n\nThis data has \nnot\n been restricted to a short piece of a chromosome and SNVs\nhave already been filtered:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nless mutect.somatic.tsv\nless delly.somatic.vcf\nless data/scones.somatic.30k.tsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nWhat can you see from this data?\n\n\nAnswer\nthe filtered output of 3 different software: Mutect (SNVs),\nDelly (SVs), SCoNEs (CNVs).\nThe 3 files show 2 different formats (vcf, tsv).\nAlmost all type of variants are represented here: mutations,\ndeletion, inversion, translocation, large amplification and deletion\n(CNVs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nWhy don\u2019t we use the vcf format for all types of calls?\n\n\nAnswer\nThe 1000 Genomes project tries to use/include SV calls in the vcf format.\nSome tools like Delly use this format for SVs. It is a good idea to try to\ninclude everything together but this not the be the best way to handle SVs and\nCNVs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nAnswer\nDue to the nature of these calls, you can not easily integrate the\npositional information of the two breakpoints (that could be located\nfar away or in an other chromosome) using a single position format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis will be done using the R program:\n\n\n1\nR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use the circlize package from the cran R project. This package generates\ncircular plots and has the advantage of being able to provide\npre-built functions for genomic data. One of the main advantages of this\ntool is the use of bed format as input data.\n\n\n1\nlibrary(circlize)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s import the variants:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nsnp\n=\nread.table\n(\n\"mutect.somatic.vcf\"\n)\n\nsv\n=\nread.table\n(\n\"somatic.sv.vcf\"\n)\n\ncnv\n=\nread.table\n(\n\"data/scones.somatic.tsv\"\n,\nheader\n=\nT\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to set up the generic graphical parameters:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\npar\n(\nmar \n=\n \nc\n(\n1\n,\n \n1\n,\n \n1\n,\n \n1\n))\n\ncircos.par\n(\n\"start.degree\"\n \n=\n \n90\n)\n\ncircos.par\n(\n\"track.height\"\n \n=\n \n0.05\n)\n\ncircos.par\n(\n\"canvas.xlim\"\n \n=\n \nc\n(\n-1.3\n,\n \n1.3\n),\n \n\"canvas.ylim\"\n \n=\n \nc\n(\n-1.3\n,\n \n1.3\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s draw hg19 reference ideograms:\n\n\n1\ncircos.initializeWithIdeogram\n(\nspecies \n=\n \n\"hg19\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately circlize does not support hg38 yet.

            "text": "We will use a dataset derived from the analysis of whole genome sequencing\npaired normal/tumour samples.  The call files are contained in the folder  visualization :   mutect.somatic.vcf     delly.somatic.vcf       scones.somatic.tsv       Many tools are available to do this and the most commonly known is Circos.\nCircos is a really not user-friendly. In this tutorial, we show you an\neasy alternative to build a circular representation of genomic data.  First we need to go in the folder  visualization  to do the analysis:  1 cd /home/trainee/visualization/   Let\u2019s see what is in this folder:  1 ls   circos.R  delly.somatic.vcf  mutect.somatic.vcf  scones.somatic.tsv  Take a look at the data files.  This data has  not  been restricted to a short piece of a chromosome and SNVs\nhave already been filtered:  1\n2\n3 less mutect.somatic.tsv\nless delly.somatic.vcf\nless data/scones.somatic.30k.tsv     Question  What can you see from this data?  Answer the filtered output of 3 different software: Mutect (SNVs),\nDelly (SVs), SCoNEs (CNVs). The 3 files show 2 different formats (vcf, tsv). Almost all type of variants are represented here: mutations,\ndeletion, inversion, translocation, large amplification and deletion\n(CNVs).    Question  Why don\u2019t we use the vcf format for all types of calls?  Answer The 1000 Genomes project tries to use/include SV calls in the vcf format.\nSome tools like Delly use this format for SVs. It is a good idea to try to\ninclude everything together but this not the be the best way to handle SVs and\nCNVs.    Question  Why?  Answer Due to the nature of these calls, you can not easily integrate the\npositional information of the two breakpoints (that could be located\nfar away or in an other chromosome) using a single position format.    The analysis will be done using the R program:  1 R   We will use the circlize package from the cran R project. This package generates\ncircular plots and has the advantage of being able to provide\npre-built functions for genomic data. One of the main advantages of this\ntool is the use of bed format as input data.  1 library(circlize)   \nLet\u2019s import the variants:  1\n2\n3 snp = read.table ( \"mutect.somatic.vcf\" ) \nsv = read.table ( \"somatic.sv.vcf\" ) \ncnv = read.table ( \"data/scones.somatic.tsv\" , header = T )    \nWe need to set up the generic graphical parameters:  1\n2\n3\n4 par ( mar  =   c ( 1 ,   1 ,   1 ,   1 )) \ncircos.par ( \"start.degree\"   =   90 ) \ncircos.par ( \"track.height\"   =   0.05 ) \ncircos.par ( \"canvas.xlim\"   =   c ( -1.3 ,   1.3 ),   \"canvas.ylim\"   =   c ( -1.3 ,   1.3 ))    \nLet\u2019s draw hg19 reference ideograms:  1 circos.initializeWithIdeogram ( species  =   \"hg19\" )    \nUnfortunately circlize does not support hg38 yet. So we will need to\nreformat our data to fit the hg19 standards. As we are working only on autosomes,\nwe won\u2019t need to lift-over and we could simply add  chr  at the beginning\nof the chromosome names.  We can now draw 1 track for somatic mutations:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5 snv_tmp = read.table ( \"data/mutec.somatic.vcf\" , comment.char = \"#\" ) \nsnv = cbind ( paste ( \"chr\" , as.character ( snp [, 1 ]), sep = \"\" ), snp [ 2 ], snp [, 2 ] +1 ) \ncircos.genomicTrackPlotRegion ( snv , stack = TRUE ,  panel.fun  =   function ( region ,  value ,   ... )   { \n    circos.genomicPoints ( region ,  value ,  cex  =   0.05 ,  pch  =   9 , col = 'orange'   ,   ... )  })    \nLet\u2019s draw the 2 tracks for CNVs. One track for duplications in red and\none blue track for deletions.   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10 dup = cnv [ cnv [, 5 ] > 2 ,] \ndup [, 1 ] = paste ( \"chr\" , as.character ( dup [, 1 ]), sep = \"\" ) \ndel = cnv [ cnv [, 5 ] < 2 ,] \ndel [, 1 ] = paste ( \"chr\" , as.character ( del [, 1 ]), sep = \"\" ) \ncircos.genomicTrackPlotRegion ( dup ,  stack  =   TRUE , panel.fun  =   function ( region ,  value ,   ... )   { \n        circos.genomicRect ( region ,  value ,  col  =   \"red\" , bg.border  =   NA ,  cex = 1   ,   ... )  }) \ncircos.genomicTrackPlotRegion ( del ,  stack  =   TRUE , panel.fun  =   function ( region ,  value ,   ... )   { \n        circos.genomicRect ( region ,  value ,  col  =   \"blue\" , bg.border  =   NA ,  cex = 1   ,   ... )  })    We can clearly see a massive deletion in chromosome 3.  \nTo finish we just need to draw 3 tracks + positional links to represent\nSVs.  Unfortunately the vcf format has not been designed for SVs. SVs are\ndefined by 2 breakpoints and the vcf format stores the second one in the\ninfo field. So we will need to extract this information to draw these\ncalls.   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10 chrEnd = NULL \nposEnd = NULL  for   ( i  in   1 : dim ( sv )[ 1 ])   { \n    addInfo = strsplit ( as.character ( sv [ i , 8 ]), split = \";\" ) \n    chrInf = strsplit ( addInfo [[ 1 ]][ 3 ], split = \"=\" ) \n    chrEnd = c ( chrEnd , chrInf [[ 1 ]][ 2 ]) \n    posInf = strsplit ( addInfo [[ 1 ]][ 4 ], split = \"=\" ) \n    posEnd = c ( posEnd , posInf [[ 1 ]][ 2 ])  } \nsvTable = data.frame ( paste ( \"chr\" , sv [, 1 ], sep = \"\" ), as.numeric ( sv [, 2 ]), as.numeric ( posEnd ), paste ( \"chr\" , chrEnd , sep = \"\" ), as.character ( sv [, 5 ]))    \nNow that we have reformatted the SV calls, let\u2019s draw them.   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15 typeE = c ( \"<DEL>\" , \"<INS>\" , \"<INV>\" ) \ncolE = c ( \"blue\" , \"black\" , \"green\" )  for   ( i  in   1 : 3 )   { \n        bed_list = svTable [ svTable [, 5 ] == typeE [ i ],] \n        circos.genomicTrackPlotRegion ( bed_list , stack = TRUE ,  panel.fun  =   function ( region ,  value ,   ... )   { \n                circos.genomicPoints ( region ,  value ,  cex  =   0.5 ,  pch  =   16 ,  col  =  colE [ i ],   ... ) \n         })  } \n\nbed1 = cbind ( svTable [ svTable [, 5 ] == \"<TRA>\" , 1 : 2 ], svTable [ svTable [, 5 ] == \"<TRA>\" , 2 ] +5 ) \nbed2 = cbind ( svTable [ svTable [, 5 ] == \"<TRA>\" , c ( 4 , 3 )], svTable [ svTable [, 5 ] == \"<TRA>\" , 3 ] +5 )  for   ( i  in   1 : dim ( bed1 )[ 1 ])   { \n    circos.link ( bed1 [ i , 1 ], bed1 [ i , 2 ], bed2 [ i , 1 ], bed2 [ i , 2 ])  }    \nA good graph needs a title and legend:  1\n2\n3 title ( \"Somatic calls (SNV - SV - CNV)\" ) \nlegend ( 0.7 , 1.4 , legend = c ( \"SNV\" ,   \"CNV-DUPLICATION\" , \"CNV-DELETION\" , \"SV-DELETION\" , \"SV-INSERTION\" , \"SV-INVERSION\" ), col = c ( \"orange\" , \"red\" , \"blue\" , \"blue\" , \"black\" , \"green\" , \"red\" ), pch = c ( 16 , 15 , 15 , 16 , 16 , 16 , 16 , 16 ), cex = 0.75 , title = \"Tracks:\" , bty = 'n' ) \nlegend ( 0.6 , 0.95 , legend = \"SV-TRANSLOCATION\" , col = \"black\" , lty = 1 , cex = 0.75 , lwd = 1.2 , bty = 'n' )    \nYou should obtain a plot like this one:    Question  Could you generate the graph and save it into a pdf file?

Cells in our bodies accumulate DNA mutations over time due to\nnormal aging processes and through exposure to carcinogens.\n\n\nRecently researchers found a method to take all the single nucleotide\nmutations identified in tumour cells (somatic SNVs) and group them\ntogether by the type of the mutation and also what the neighbouring\nbases are. This is commonly referred to as somatic mutational\nsignatures. Common mutational processes that are regularly identified in cancer\nsequencing are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge: the aging process. These are high in C/T transitions due to\n    deamination of methyl-cytidine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmoking: marks exposure to inhaled carcinogens and has high numbers\n    of C/A transversions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUV: UV exposure. These are also high in C/T transitions at\n    di-pyrimidine sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRCA: Indicates that the homologous recombination repair pathway is\n    defective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPOBEC: Thought to be marking dysregulated APOBEC enzyme activity on\n    single stranded DNA produced during the repair processing of other\n    lesions such as double stand breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMMR: Mismatch repair pathway not working properly. These are high in\n    C/T mutations too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cohort cancer analysis it is common to try to generate subtypes to\ngroup your data based on a particular molecular phenotype. A reason for\ndoing may include finding sets of patients that have a similar form of\nthe disease and therefore all might benefit from a particular treatment.\nWe can use the somatic mutational signatures analysis to group the data\nfrom a cohort of patients to inform which genomes are most similar based\non the pattern of exposures or processes that have contributed to their\ngenome changes. The patients don\u2019t have to have the same type of cancer\nso pan-cancer studies are using this analysis to find similarities\nacross cancer types.\n\n\n\n\nPreparing the R environment\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe mathematical framework developed by Alexandrov \net al.\n was implemented\nin MATLAB. We are going to use a version implemented in R by Gehring \net\nal.\n called \nSomaticSignatures package\n, that is very quick and flexible\nbut currently only accepts point mutations not insertions or deletions\n(indels). In tests on our data we have found that the Somatic Signatures\npackage in R returns very similar results to the full implementation of\nAlexandrov\u2019s framework.\n\n\nThe data files you will need are contained in the subdirectory called\n\nsomatic/somatic_signatures\n:\n\n\nOpen the Terminal and go to the \nsomatic_signatures\n working directory:\n\n\n1\n2\ncd\n ~/somatic/somatic_signatures\n\npwd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this folder you should find 12 files that end with the extension\n\n.vcf\n. Use the list command to make sure you can see them.\n\n\n1\nls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese files contain data extracted from the TCGA melanoma paper and\nAustralian ICGC ovarian paper both mentioned in the introductory slides.\nThey have been edited in order to allow this practical to run quickly\nand are not good examples of VCF files.\n\n\nStart R and set the working directory. Just start by typing R onto the\ncommand line.\n\n\n1\nR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad all the package libraries needed for this analysis by running the\ncommands.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nlibrary\n(\nSomaticSignatures\n)\n\n\nlibrary\n(\nBSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19\n)\n\n\nlibrary\n(\nggplot2\n)\n\n\nlibrary\n(\nCairo\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the directory where any output files will be generated\n\n\n1\nsetwd\n(\n\"~/somatic/somatic_signatures\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading and preparing the SNV mutation data\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe mutations used in this analysis need to be high quality somatic\nmutations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember the goal is to find the key mutational processes that these\n    tumours have been exposed to, so you need to exclude germline\n    mutations (mutations that the person was born with that can be seen\n    in the sequencing of matched normal samples).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequencing errors can also occur at particular DNA sequence contexts\n    and can also be picked up using this method. To avoid this use only\n    high quality mutation calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead in the mutations from the 12 VCF files\n\n\n1\nfiles \n<-\n \nlist.files\n(\n\"~/somatic/somatic_signatures\"\n,\n pattern\n=\n\"vcf$\"\n,\n full.names\n=\nTRUE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make sure all the files are listed run the command.\n\n\n1\nfiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see a list of 12 sample files.\n\n\nNext read in all the genomic positions of variants in the VCF files\nusing the \nvranges\n class.\n\n\n1\nvranges \n<-\n \nlapply\n(\nfiles\n,\n \nfunction\n(\nv\n)\n readVcfAsVRanges\n(\nv\n,\n\"hg19\"\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin all the lists of variant positions into one big data set so that it\ncan be processed together and look at what is contained in the\nconcatenated \nvranges\n data\n\n\n1\n2\nvranges.cat \n<-\n \ndo.call\n(\nc\n,\nvranges\n)\n\nvranges.cat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first line of output of the \nvranges.cat\n shows us that in total we\nhave put over 100,000 mutations recording the chromosome positions and\nmutation base changes along with what sample they were seen in.\n\n\nNote there are a lot of NA values in this data set because we have left\nout non-essential information in order to cut down on the processing\ntime.\n\n\nNext we need to ensure all the positions in the \nvranges\n object have been\nrecorded in UCSC notation form so that they will match up with the\nreference we are using.\n\n\n1\nvranges.cat \n<-\n ucsc\n(\nvranges.cat\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is always important to select the correct reference for your data.\n\n\nWe can print out how many mutations we have read in for each of the\ncancer samples we are using by using the command.\n\n\n1\nprint\n(\ntable\n(\nsampleNames\n(\nvranges.cat\n)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have now added all the positional and base change information now we\ncan use the reference and the position of the mutation to look up the\nbases on either side of the mutation i.e. the mutation context.\n\n\nRun the mutationContext function of SomaticSignatures.\n\n\n1\nmc \n<-\n mutationContext\n(\nvranges.cat\n,\n BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can inspect what information we had added to the \nvranges.cat\n object\nby typing \nmc\n on the command line. Notice that the mutation and its\ncontext have been added to the last two columns.\n\n\n1\nmc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNV mutation context\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere are a total of 96 possible single base mutations and context\ncombinations. We can calculate this by listing out the six possible\ntypes of single nucleotide mutations:\n\n\n\n  -   C/A   the reverse compliment (G/T) is also in this group\n  -   C/G   includes (G/C)\n  -   C/T   includes (G/C)\n  -   T/A   includes (A/T)\n  -   T/C   includes (A/G)\n  -   T/G   includes (A/C)\n  \n\n\nThe neighbouring bases, on either side of a mutation, are referred to as\nthe mutation context. There are 16 possible combinations of mutation\ncontexts. Here [.] stands for one of the mutations listed above.\n\n\n\n  -   A[.]A   A[.]C   A[.]G   A[.]T\n  -   C[.]A   C[.]C   C[.]G   C[.]T\n  -   G[.]A   G[.]C   G[.]G   G[.]T\n  -   T[.]A   T[.]C   T[.]G   T[.]T\n  \n\n\nNow if we substitute the [.]\u2019s with each of the 6 different mutations\nyou will find there are 96 possible types of combined mutations and\ncontexts (6 x 16).\n\n\nStart by substituting [.] for the A/C mutation type\n\n\n\n  -   A[C/A]A\n  -   A[C/A]C\n  -   A[C/A]G\n  -   A[C/A]T\n  -   C[C/A]A\n  -   C[C/A]C\n  -   C[C/A]G\n  \n\n\nand so on\u2026\n\n\nWe assign all the somatic mutations identified in a single tumour to one\nof these categories and total up the number in each.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nWhat about a mutation that looks like G[A/C]A, where should this go?\n\n\nHint\nRemember to reverse compliment all the nucleotides.\n\n\nAnswer\nIn the T[T/G]C context count.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have all the information that is needed for each sample we can\nmake a matrix that contains counts of mutations in each of the 96\npossible combinations of mutations and contexts counting up the totals\nseparately for each sample\n\n\n1\n2\nmm \n<-\n motifMatrix\n(\nmc\n,\n group \n=\n \n\"sampleNames\"\n,\n normalize\n=\nTRUE\n)\n\n\ndim\n(\nmm\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output of the \ndim(mm)\n command show us that there are 96 rows\n(these are the context values) and 12 columns which are the 12 samples.\n\n\n\n\nRunning the NMF analysis\n\u00b6\n\n\nUsing the matrix we have made we can now run the non-negative matrix\nfactorisation (NMF) process that attempts to find the most stable,\ngrouping solutions for all of the combinations of mutations and\ncontexts. It does this by trying to find similar patterns, or profiles,\namongst the samples to sort the data into firstly just 2 groups. This is\nrepeated to get replicate values for each attempt and then separating\nthe data by 3 groups, and then 4 and so on.\n\n\nThese parameter choices have been made to keep running time short for\nthis practical. If you have more samples from potentially diverse\nsources you may need to run with a larger range of signatures and with\nmore replicates.\n\n\nTo find out how many signatures we have in the data run the command.\n\n\n1\ngof_nmf \n<-\n assessNumberSignatures\n(\nmm\n,\n \n2\n:\n10\n,\n nReplicates \n=\n \n5\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualise the results from the NMF processing by making a pdf of the\nplot\n\n\n1\n2\n3\npdf\n(\nfile\n=\n\"plotNumberOfSignatures.pdf\"\n,\n width\n=\n9\n,\n height\n=\n8\n)\n\nplotNumberSignatures\n(\ngof_nmf\n)\n\ndev.off\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen up the PDF and examine the curve. The plotNumberOfSignatures PDF\nthat will have been made in the working directory that you set up at the\nbeginning\n\n\n \nFigure 1:\n This plot is used to find the number of signatures that is likely to be the best grouping solution. The top plot shows the decreasing residual sum of squares for each\nincreasing number of signatures and the bottom plot the increasing explained variance as\nthe number of potential signatures increases. Ideally the best solution will be the lowest\nnumber of signatures with a low RSS and a high explained variance.\n\n\n\nLook at the y-axis scale on the bottom panel of Figure 1.

            "text": "The most common genetic model for cancer development is the accumulation\nof DNA mutations over time, eventually leading to the disruption or\ndysregulation of enough key genes that lead cells to uncontrolled\ngrowth. Cells in our bodies accumulate DNA mutations over time due to\nnormal aging processes and through exposure to carcinogens.  Recently researchers found a method to take all the single nucleotide\nmutations identified in tumour cells (somatic SNVs) and group them\ntogether by the type of the mutation and also what the neighbouring\nbases are. This is commonly referred to as somatic mutational\nsignatures. Common mutational processes that are regularly identified in cancer\nsequencing are:    Age: the aging process. These are high in C/T transitions due to\n    deamination of methyl-cytidine.    Smoking: marks exposure to inhaled carcinogens and has high numbers\n    of C/A transversions.    UV: UV exposure. These are also high in C/T transitions at\n    di-pyrimidine sites.    BRCA: Indicates that the homologous recombination repair pathway is\n    defective.    APOBEC: Thought to be marking dysregulated APOBEC enzyme activity on\n    single stranded DNA produced during the repair processing of other\n    lesions such as double stand breaks.    MMR: Mismatch repair pathway not working properly. These are high in\n    C/T mutations too.    \nIn cohort cancer analysis it is common to try to generate subtypes to\ngroup your data based on a particular molecular phenotype. A reason for\ndoing may include finding sets of patients that have a similar form of\nthe disease and therefore all might benefit from a particular treatment.\nWe can use the somatic mutational signatures analysis to group the data\nfrom a cohort of patients to inform which genomes are most similar based\non the pattern of exposures or processes that have contributed to their\ngenome changes. The patients don\u2019t have to have the same type of cancer\nso pan-cancer studies are using this analysis to find similarities\nacross cancer types.",

Question  This is an open question for discussion at the end of the practical.  How can this analysis be useful for cancer genomics studies?    Advanced exercise  Now rerun the process this time using 4 signatures as the solution.  Hint You don\u2019t have to start back at the beginning but you can jump to\nthe step where you run the NMF but this time for 4 instead of 3\nsignatures. Then continue through making the plots. You will need to\nchange the name of each plot you remake with 4 signatures because\nCairo won\u2019t let you overwrite and existing file.  Can you find a good match in the set of known signatures for all 4 patterns?  Can you find a verified process for all of the profiles you are seeing?",

They are\nimportant to a tumour cell as they confer a growth or survival advantage\nover the normal surrounding cells. The mutations in these driver genes\nare then clonally selected for as the population of tumour cells\nincreases. We think of the key genes driving tumour initiation\n(development), progression, metastases, resistance and survival. Driver\ngene mutations are often described as \u201cearly\u201d events because they were\nkey in turning a normally functioning and regulated cell into a\ndysregulated one. The logical assumption is that these key mutations\nwill be present in all tumour cells in a patient\u2019s sample; although\nsometime this is not true.\n\n\nThere are two major research goals that underline the need to identify\ndriver genes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy identifying the early changes that take place researchers might\n    be able to find a treatment to stop the root cause of why cells\n    become malignant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy identifying groups of patients with the same genes mutated then\n    we can develop therapies that will work for all of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we sequence tumour samples we tend to use samples that come from\nfully developed cancers that can carry hundreds to thousands of\nmutations in genes and many more outside of genes. The accumulation of\nthese passenger mutations in cancer cells can happen because often the\nrepair mechanisms or damage sensing processes are amongst the first\npathways to become disrupted accelerating the mutational rate. Mutations\nthat occur in genes after the cell has become cancerous may still affect\nthe growth rate, invasiveness and even the response to chemotherapy but\nmay not be present in all cells of a tumour. These genes may be drivers\nof chemo-resistance or metastasis and are equally good targets for\ntherapies.\n\n\nIntOGen-mutations is a platform that aims to identify driver mutations\nusing two methodologies from cancer cohort mutation data: the first\nidentifies mutations that are most likely to have a functional impact\ncombined with identifying genes that are frequently mutated; and the\nsecond, genes that harbour clustered mutations. These measures are all\nindicators of positive selection that occurs in cancer evolution and may\nhelp the identification of driver genes.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysing cancer cohort data with IntOGen\n\u00b6\n\n\nIntOGen-mutations is available as a web based service that can allow \nusers to run their analysis on the host\u2019s servers or it can be downloaded \nand run on a local server.\n\n\nFor the purposes of the course we will be using a local version of\n\nIntOGen\n so that we don\u2019t encounter any issues sharing resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo begin open a terminal and navigate to the directory \nsomatic/intogen\n.\n\n\n1\ncd\n ~/somatic/intogen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this directory you will find a Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) file \ncontaining a cut down version of the somatic variant calls identified from\nmelanoma samples investigated as part of the TCGA cancer genomics projects.\nYou can see what files are in the directory by typing \nls\n, look inside the \nfile using \nless TCGA_Melanoma_SMgene.maf\n and close the file and return to\nthe command line by typing \nq\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the \nIntOGen\n analysis by typing\n\n\n1\nintogen -i TCGA_Melanoma_SMgene.maf -o TCGA_Mela_out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TCGA melanoma maf used in this practical has been modified from the\noriginal to reduce processing time and only contains data for the top\n680 mutated genes.\n\n\nThe tool will take around 10 minutes to run and the progress will be\nindicated by the logging lines printed to the terminal. Once complete\nthe output can be explored.\n\n\nWhilst the tool is running we can explore the options we have used to\nrun \nIntOGen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get a list of \nIntOGen\n options open up a new terminal\n\n\n1\nintogen --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will list the running options that you can alter as command line\ninputs or in a configuration file. We are using the default options for this run\nso we didn\u2019t have to supply a configuration file and we only used \n-i\n to set\nthe input and \n-o\n to control the mane of the output directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo look at the default options open up the configuration file by typing\n\n\n1\n2\nless ~./intogen/task.conf\nless ~./intogen/system.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to set the correct genome assembly in the \ntask.conf\n to match\nthe one that you used as your reference when the variant were called.

The \nOncodriveFM\n \nmodule detects genes that have accumulated mutations with a high functional \nimpact. It uses annotations from the Ensembl variant effect predictor (VEP, V.70) \nthat includes SIFT and Polyphen2 and precomputed MutationAssessor functional \nimpacts. It calculates a P value per gene from the number of mutations detected\nacross all possible coding bases of a gene with a positive weighting for mutations\nwith a high functional impact. The \nOncodriveCLUST\n module detects genes that \nhave more variants than would be expected across the cohort that alter the \nsame region of the gene.\n\n\nThe file is sorted to bring the most significantly altered genes to the top. The key\ncolumns that help you identify the significantly mutated genes are the 3\nrd\n and 4\nth\n \n(C and D) that indicate which of the modules identified a significant result and \nthe Q-values for the modules that are in 21\nst\n and 23\nrd\n (U and W)\n\n\nThe top twelve genes have significant Q-values for both modules and include BRAF, \nNRAS and TP53. The next 35 are significant by only one of the modules.\n\n\nAll of these have small Q-values which means they are all\nsignificantly mutated genes in this TCGA Melanoma cohort of 338\npatients.\n\n\n\n\nNow look at their sample frequency count (column 9 \nMUTS_CS_SAMPLES\n) these\nare the number of samples that contain at least one mutation in the gene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\na)   Which significantly mutated gene has mutations in the most samples?\n\n\nb)   Which gene/genes have the lowest Q-value from OncodriveFM and OncodriveCLUST?\n\n\nc)   Why don\u2019t the genes with the lowest Q values also have the highest sample frequency value?\n\n\nAnswer\na)  BRAF has 175 out of 327 cases with a mutation.\nb)  TP53 or PTEN have the lowest OncodriveFM Q-values and NRAS\nhas the lowest Q-value for OncodriveCLUST.\nc)  The P value calculation takes into account the length of the\n    coding sequence of the gene, the mutation rate of the nucleotides\n    contained within it and for OncodriveFM the functional consequences\n    of those changes. Therefore a small gene with a small number of deleterious\n    mutations may have a lower P value and also Q value than a large\n    gene with a high mutation frequency.\n\n\n\n\nThe results for the assessment of clustered mutations in genes carried\nout by the \nOncodriveCLUST\n module of \nIntOGen\n are shown as  amino\nacid residue positions of the encoded protein.\n\n\nThe three known oncogenes BRAF, NRAS and IDH1 have very low CLUST_QVALUEs\nindicating that the mutations in these genes are highly clustered. The \n\nCLUST_COORDS\n column reports that there are 160 samples with mutations \nbetween the amino acid positions 594-601 of BRAF; 84 samples with mutations\nat amino acid position 61 of NRAS; and 15 sample with mutations at amino \nacid position 132 of IDH1.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nWhy are the oncogenes more likely to have clustered mutations and the\ntumour suppressor genes less likely?\n\n\nAnswer\nGain of function mutations are required to activate oncogenes and so\nonly key residues in the protein will result in activation. Tumour\nsuppressors are frequently affected by loss of function mutations and\ndeletions. A truncating mutation or frameshift indel can occur in any\nexon, except the last one, and have the same deleterious functional\nresult.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other files in the output support the information in this sheet.\n\n\nThe \nsample_variant+transcript.impact\n file includes a summary of all mutations \nfound in each of the genes and protein coding transcripts of those genes for all \nsamples identified that have that mutation. It also reports the variant impact scores\nfrom SIFT, PolyPhen2, MutationAssesor, reporting also impact categories of which\nthere are four; high, medium, low and none.\n\n\n\n\nOpen up the \nsample_variant+transcript.impact\n file and explore the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nCan you find out what the nucleotide change details for the most common\nBRAF mutation that results in V600E amino acid change in the cohort?\nSort the data by GENE, then TRANSCRIPT and then PROTEIN_POS to make this easier. The gene ID for BRAF is \nENSG00000157764\n.\n\n\nAnswer\nIt is an A>T at position chr7:140453136 identified in 127 samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\u00b6\n\n\nGunes et al. Nat.

Now look at their sample frequency count (column 9  MUTS_CS_SAMPLES ) these\nare the number of samples that contain at least one mutation in the gene.    Question  a)   Which significantly mutated gene has mutations in the most samples?  b)   Which gene/genes have the lowest Q-value from OncodriveFM and OncodriveCLUST?  c)   Why don\u2019t the genes with the lowest Q values also have the highest sample frequency value?  Answer a)  BRAF has 175 out of 327 cases with a mutation. b)  TP53 or PTEN have the lowest OncodriveFM Q-values and NRAS\nhas the lowest Q-value for OncodriveCLUST. c)  The P value calculation takes into account the length of the\n    coding sequence of the gene, the mutation rate of the nucleotides\n    contained within it and for OncodriveFM the functional consequences\n    of those changes.

Question  Why are the oncogenes more likely to have clustered mutations and the\ntumour suppressor genes less likely?  Answer Gain of function mutations are required to activate oncogenes and so\nonly key residues in the protein will result in activation. Tumour\nsuppressors are frequently affected by loss of function mutations and\ndeletions. A truncating mutation or frameshift indel can occur in any\nexon, except the last one, and have the same deleterious functional\nresult.   \nThe other files in the output support the information in this sheet.  The  sample_variant+transcript.impact  file includes a summary of all mutations \nfound in each of the genes and protein coding transcripts of those genes for all \nsamples identified that have that mutation. It also reports the variant impact scores\nfrom SIFT, PolyPhen2, MutationAssesor, reporting also impact categories of which\nthere are four; high, medium, low and none.   Open up the  sample_variant+transcript.impact  file and explore the data.    Question  Can you find out what the nucleotide change details for the most common\nBRAF mutation that results in V600E amino acid change in the cohort?\nSort the data by GENE, then TRANSCRIPT and then PROTEIN_POS to make this easier. The gene ID for BRAF is  ENSG00000157764 .  Answer It is an A>T at position chr7:140453136 identified in 127 samples.",
