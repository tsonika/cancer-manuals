# Welcome to Cancer Genomics
### The University of Sydney
###25th - 27th July 2017
<br>

The Cancer Genomics workshop aims to provide an introduction to cancer genomics analytical pipelines for single nucleotide variations (SNV), copy number variations (CNV) and structural variations (SV).

## Workshop Content
By the end of the course participants will be able to:<br>
• Ability to perform NGS alignment and manipulate the output,<br>
• Consider and plan experimental design, <br>
• Be able to identify and generate variants (SNV, CNV, SV, Indels), <br>
• Interpret variants with potential clinical interest,<br>
• Be able to visualise and present data<br>

This workshop will be delivered using a mixture of lectures, hands-on practical sessions, and open discussions.
